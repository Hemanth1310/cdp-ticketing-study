        <p>  Thank you for your interest in taking part in our study.</p>
        <p> 
            You will use two different flight booking apps to book this flight. As you interact with the apps, think about:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>How clear and easy the process is.</li>
            <li>Whether the app feels trustworthy and straightforward.</li>
            <li>If the app meets your needs without making you feel pressured or misled</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After using each app, youâ€™ll answer a set of questions about your experience. 
        </p>
        <p>Thank you for your participation!</p>
